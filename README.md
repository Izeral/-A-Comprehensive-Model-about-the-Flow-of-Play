### Introduction
&ensp; In this project, we proposed a method to analysis the role of the "momentum" play in the tennis contest.
&ensp; We figure out the following problems:
- We develop a model that captures the flow of play as points occur and apply it to one or more of the matches to provide a visualization based on our model to depict the match flow.
- We confirm the importance of the "momentum" in the match based on the hypothesis test.
- Except predict these swings in the match, we also proposed a method based on the random forest algorithm to predict the whole match.
- We extend our model to the other types of matches like the tennis doubles match.
- We also test other metrix like the rank of the player if they were useful for our model.
